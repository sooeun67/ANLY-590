Sequence to sequence(Seq2Seq) model has been developed for translating a lanugage into a different language. The goal of this research is to apply Seq2Seq network to develop a text summarization model that summarizes news articles into headlines. Following the goal, we develop a deep learning model for abstractive text summarization using Gated Recurrent Units and trained it on US news articles.
